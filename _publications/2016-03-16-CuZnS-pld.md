<b>Limerick</b>:
<br>( this was pre sci-ku, but equally as dorkalicious =D )

One day zinc sulfide met copper
A p-type transparent conductor?
We used PLD
Then we tried CBD
And the findings were really a ~shocker~

The new films conducted quite well!
So we took them to SSRL.
And stayed up for days-es
To locate the phases
And find where conductive paths dwell.

This phase space has such mystery
The WAXS patterns can guarantee:
Both cation integration
And phase segregation
So download this paper and see!
