<b>Limerick</b>:
<br>( this was pre sci-ku, but equally as dorkalicious =D )
<br>
<br>One day zinc sulfide met copper
<br>A p-type transparent conductor?
<br>We used PLD
<br>Then we tried CBD
<br>And the findings were really a ~shocker~
<br>
<br>The new films conducted quite well!
<br>So we took them to SSRL.
<br>And stayed up for days-es
<br>To locate the phases
<br>And find where conductive paths dwell.
<br>
<br>This phase space has such mystery
<br>The WAXS patterns can guarantee:
<br>Both cation integration
<br>And phase segregation
<br>So download this paper and see!
