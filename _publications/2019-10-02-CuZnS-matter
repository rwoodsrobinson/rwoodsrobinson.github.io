Advancing renewable energy technologies requires development of new materials. One missing link in photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are semiconductors that are optically transparent and electrically conductive, a combination of properties that is rare in nature. In particular, so-called “p-type” transparent conductors (TCs) could enable more efficient charge extraction in PV, so extensive research has ensued to find suitable p-type TCs.

This work elucidates the evolution of crystal structure and physical properties across a non-oxide p-type TC system formed by alloying transparent ZnS with p-type conductive Cu<sub>y</sub>S. The method of selecting two binary endpoints and tailoring their properties is a promising pathway to discover and optimize new p-type TCs. By coupling combinatorial experiments with theoretical calculations, we demonstrate a high-throughput approach to design properties of PV materials.
